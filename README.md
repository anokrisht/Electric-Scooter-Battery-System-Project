# Electric-Scooter-Battery-System-Project
This project focused on designing and building a 48V battery system to power a 1000-watt electric scooter. The system involved creating a robust and efficient power source while ensuring safety and durability through precise battery arrangement and management.

Battery Design: Designed the arrangement of lithium-ion cells to optimize space and performance, ensuring the system could handle the 1000-watt load while maintaining stable voltage and current output.

Battery Management System (BMS): Integrated a Battery Management System (BMS) to monitor cell voltage, temperature, and current, ensuring safe charging, discharging, and protection against overvoltage, undervoltage, and short circuits.

3D Modeling and Printing: Created 3D models of the battery enclosure and cell holder using SolidWorks, focusing on durability, compactness, and ease of access for maintenance. The models were then 3D-printed to house the battery cells securely and provide heat dissipation.

Enclosure and Holder: Designed and printed a custom battery enclosure and holder to keep the cells in place and protect the system from physical damage while maintaining airflow for cooling.

This project combined electrical design with mechanical engineering and 3D printing to create a functional, safe, and efficient battery system tailored for an electric scooter.
